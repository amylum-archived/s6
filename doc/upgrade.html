<h1> How to upgrade s6 </h1>

<h2> from 1.1.3 to 1.1.3.1 </h2>
    
<ul>                                                                       
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> dependency
changed to 1.6.0.0 </li>                                                      
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> dependency
changed to 1.3.1.1 </li>
</ul>

<h2> from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> dependency
changed to 1.5.1. </li>
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> dependency
changed to 1.3.1. </li>
</ul>

<h2> from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> dependency
changed to 1.5.0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.4.2 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a>, as well as
version 1.2.4 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>, are
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>

<h2> from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.4.0 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a>, as well as
version 1.2.2 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>, are
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>


<p>
 The s6lock library has been added and the s6-setlock binary
modified to use it, but no change in dependencies has been added.
It is, as always, recommended to use the latest version of skalibs
(and also execline to a lesser extent).
</p>

<h2> from 0.17 to 1.0.0 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.3.0 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a>, as well as
version 1.2.0 or later of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>, are
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>

<p>
 FHS support has been added. See the end of
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/slashpackage.html">this page</a>
for the rationale, and the
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/conf-compile.html">general skarnet.org
configuration page</a> for how to proceed.
 <br />
 This means you can now install the s6 binaries wherever you want. <br />
 However, since s6 binaries sometimes
call other s6 binaries, and non-slashpackage installations cannot
guarantee absolute paths, s6 programs now rely on the PATH environment
variable to find all their executables on non-slashpackage installations; in
other words, if you are not extra careful with how you are setting up your
PATH, things might break.
</p>

<h2> from 0.16 to 0.17 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.2.8 or later of
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a>, as well as
version 1.1.5 or later of
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a>, are
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>

<h2> from 0.14 or 0.15 to 0.16 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.2.6 or later of
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> is
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>

<h2> from 0.13 to 0.14 or 0.15 </h2>

<p>
 No change in dependencies.
</p>

<h2> from 0.12 to 0.13 </h2>

<p>
 Version 1.1.1 or later of
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> is
needed to build and/or run s6.
</p>

<h2> from 0.11 to 0.12 </h2>

<p>
 You are advised to use at least version 1.0.2 of
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a>,
for build-time as well as run-time (if you depend on shared
skalibs libraries), since older versions have a bug that
impacts s6.
</p>

<h2> from 0.10 to 0.11 </h2>

<p>
 No change in dependencies.
