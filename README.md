This is my package repo for [s6](http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/index.html), an init/supervisor system written by [Laurent Bercot](http://skarnet.org/).

The `upstream/` directory is taken directly from upstream. The rest of the repository is my packaging scripts for compiling a distributable build.
